This repository contains is a simplified Rust SDK for Rokid Air, Nreal Light and Mad Gaze Glow AR glasses.
It supports getting basic sensor data and setting up the display.

While only the these glasses is supported right now, if I could get my hands on some other
ones, I'd happily support them too.

There's a [somewhat detailed blogpost documenting the various protocols](https://voidcomputing.hu/blog/good-bad-ugly/)
too. So if you're only intereted in that, you won't even need to read Rust code :)

## Contribution

I appreciate reported bugs, feature requests and of course pull request.

I'd love to have a Rokid Max, an Nreal Air or Moverio so if
you have a spare one you'd throw out, you could mail it to me instead :)

## Legal stuff

Some parts of the protocols were obtained with reverse engineering.

Reverse engineering explicitly allowed in the EU for interworking purposes,
it's probably fair use everywhere else, but you should check your own
country's laws.

The project is not affiliated with Nreal, Mad Gaze, Rokid, or any other related entities.
