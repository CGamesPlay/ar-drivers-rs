This repository contains is a simplified driver for Rokid Air, Nreal Light and Mad Gaze Glow AR glasses.
It supports getting basic sensor data and setting up the display.

While only the these glasses is supported right now, if I could get my hands on some other
ones, I'd happily support them too.

If you find Rust disgusting (and I wouldn't blame you), you could take a look
at the code and reimplement the driver of your choice in any other language, 
since they are rather simple (especially the Rokid one).

## Contribution

I appreciate reported bugs, feature requests and of course pull request.

I'd love to have a Rokid MAx, Rokid Lite, an Nreal Air or Moverio so if
you have a spare one you'd throw out, you could mail it to me instead :)

## Legal stuff

Some parts of the protocol was obtained with reverse engineering.

Reverse engineering explicitly allowed in the EU for interworking purposes,
it's probably fair use everywhere else, but you should check your own
country's laws.
